                    The Ab3d.PowerToys library can be also used to create some advanced 3D objects:\n
                    \* \!HeightMap\!,\n
                    \* \!TubePath\!,\n
                    \* Objects \!extruded\! from a 2D shape,\n
                    \* 2D shape \!extruded\! along a 3D path,\n
                    \* \!Lathe\! objects that are created with rotating a 2D shape around a center axis,\n
                    \* Objects created with \!Boolean operations\!,\n
                    \* \!Sliced\! 3D objects.\n
