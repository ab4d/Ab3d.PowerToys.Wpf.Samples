                    Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) is an open source library that can \!read 3D models\! from the following file formats (the list is generated from Assimp library):

                    Note that importing fbx files is supported only for versions FBX_2011 and later.\n
                    Some file format are supported very well, but others may have some problems.\n
                    \n
                    If you find some files that are not imported correctly, please check if the problem is in the assimp importer or in the managed wrapper that comes with Ab3d.PowerToys library. 
                    To do that, download the open3mod application (from http://www.open3mod.com) that is a reference assimp viewer. If the file is correctly opened in open3mod, than the problem is in the Ab3d.PowerToys.Assimp library. In this case please send me the file so I can check it. If the file was not correctly opened in open3mod, then I can only ask you to contact the Assimp developers and try to persuade them to improve the importer.\n                  
                    \n
                    \n
                    The library can also \!export 3D models\! to the Collada (.dae), obj, ply and stl files.\n
                    Limitations of the Assimp exporter are:\n
                    - stl and ply files do not support materials\n
                    - Assimp does not support expoting cameras and lights into Collada (.dae) files\n
                    - BackMaterial or some other form of two-sided materials is not supported by any file format\n              
                    \n
                    \n
                    Assimp importer is a native library and comes with 32-bit and 64-bit build (Assimp32.dll, Assimp64.dll). The Assimp library also needs two native libraries from Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012: msvcp110.dll and msvcr110.dll.\n
                    \n
                    To use native assimp library in .Net code, we also need an Open Source Assimp.Net library that is a managed wrapper for assimp library. On top of that we use Ab3d.PowerToys.Assimp library that converts the Assimp 3D Scene object into WPF 3D objects.\n
                    \n
                    See the \!"Ab3d.PowerToys.Assimp.chm" help file\! for more information how to setup a project to use Assimp library.
