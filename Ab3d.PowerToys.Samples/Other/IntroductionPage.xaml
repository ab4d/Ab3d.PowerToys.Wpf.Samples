\!Ab3d.PowerToys is the ultimate 3D toolkit library for desktop .Net applications.\!\n
\n
It is used by many professional 3D applications around the world.\n
\n
The library is using WPF 3D rendering engine. For more complex 3D scenarios the library can be extended by the super fast \@Ab3d.DXEngine:https://www.ab4d.com/DXEngine.aspx| rendering engine.\n
\n
\n
The main features of the library are:\n
\n
\*Simplified usage of \!cameras\! with \!mouse\!, \!touch\! and \!multi-touch camera rotation\! and \!movement\!.\n
\*Many basic \!3D models\! (Sphere, Box, Cylinder, etc.) with advanced \!extruded\!, \!lathe\! and \!Boolean\! 3D objects.\n
\*\!Import 3D models\! from obj files, from 3ds files (with Ab3d.Reader3ds) or almost all other 3D files with Assimp importer.\n
\*\!Many samples\! that can be used as code snippets for your application.\n
\*\!Premium support\! for all questions regarding 3D graphics and our libraries.\n
