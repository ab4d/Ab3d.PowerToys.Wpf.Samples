\!Ab3d.PowerToys is the ultimate helper library to create .Net applications with 3D content.\!\n
\n
The main features of the library are:\n
\n
\*\!Simplified development\! with Visual Studio and design time support - the 3D scene can be previewed in the design window.\n
\*Simplified usage of \!cameras\! with \!mouse\!, \!touch\! and \!multi-touch camera rotation\! and \!movement\!.\n
\*Many basic \!3D models\! (Sphere, Box, Cylinder, etc.) with advanced \!extruded\! and \!lathe\! 3D objects.\n
\*The \!best\! implementation of \!3D lines\! and \!3D text\! (\!connected\!, \!disconnected\! and lines with \!arrows\!).\n
\*Simplified \!mouse event handling\! on 3D objects (subscribe to MouseOver, Click and similar events).\n
\*\!Import 3D models\! from obj files, from 3ds files (with Ab3d.Reader3ds) or almost all other 3D files with Assimp importer.\n
\*\!Export 3D models\! to Collada (.dae), obj, ply and stl files (using Assimp exporter).\n
\*\!Fully optimized\! to achieve \!best\! possible \!performance\!.\n
\*\!Active development\! with adding many features based on user requests.\n
